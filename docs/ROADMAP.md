## Store (store.brika.dev)

Largely built. Remaining:

- 🟡 **Finish the redesign**: a marketplace direction (Spotlight vs Console) is
  pending a pick, then carry the chosen layout across browse / detail / profile /
  dashboard and remove the dev toggle.
- ✅ **Console management**: a server-side auth guard plus scope claiming, scope
  member/role management (last-admin guarded), the verified-publisher
  display name, per-version deprecate/yank, and publish-token issue/revoke - all by
  reusing the registry domain (`ScopeService`/`ManagementService`/`TokenStore`) against
  the shared D1 (the registry's pure D1 adapters now live in `@brika/store-db/adapters`).
- ✅ **Scope ownership**: the scope (`@brika`) is the ownership **account** itself
  (npm/JSR model) - there is no separate organisation layer. Membership + the
  last-admin invariant live directly on the scope (`reg_scopes`, `reg_scope_members`,
  `ScopeService`). The console manages scopes at `/dashboard/scopes` (claim,
  members/roles, verified display name, profile, domains, trusted publishers), and the
  public `store.brika.dev/@scope` page is the rich publisher profile. Anti-squat: claim
  rate limit (ORG-004) + per-account scope cap (ORG-005, `maxScopesPerAccount`).
  Identity-tied claiming (ORG-006) is wired as a provider-agnostic `ClaimVerifier` seam
  (allow-all today) - the real verifier is a fast follow. The earlier 1:N
  "organisation owns scopes" model (`ORG-001`/`002`/`003`/`008`) was collapsed back into
  the scope and those specs are retired to `gone` (see
  [ADR 0001](./adr/0001-organisation-1n-model.md)).
- ⬜ **Auth + identity rework**: adopt **BetterAuth** for console sign-in -
  provider-agnostic social sign-in (GitHub now, Google/GitLab/etc. pluggable),
  account linking, and DB-backed sessions via its Drizzle/D1 adapter on Workers
  (`AUTH-010`..`AUTH-013`), replacing the hand-rolled GitHub-only OAuth + stateless
  signed-cookie session (`AUTH-001`/`002`/`003`, kept `done` until BetterAuth ships).
  The **account** becomes the first-class identity (`USER-001`; drop the `developers`
  table and stored `pluginCount`), with a user-authored profile - never npm-derived
  (`USER-005`) - editable in the console (`CONSOLE-012`/`USER-003`), link/unlink in
  `USER-004`, and a public page at `store.brika.dev/u/:id` (`USER-002`) that replaces
  the gone npm-maintainer `/developers/:id` page (`STORE-004`). The registry CLI
  device-auth (`AUTH-008`) and token/OIDC publish path (`PUB-016`) are unchanged. See
  [ADR 0003](./adr/0003-betterauth-and-user-profiles.md).
- ⬜ **Console slices still to build**: review responses + comment moderation.
  (Editable per-plugin listing overrides were dropped: the listing is the
  published manifest; the per-plugin page is version management only.)
- ⬜ **Verified-list signing**: the Ed25519 `/v1/verified` signing key (today the
  verified list is empty). The store is registry-only, so there is no npm catalog
  to sync.

## Registry (registry.brika.dev)

- ✅ **M1 resolve**: `@brika/registry-core` (resolve), `@brika/store-db` (`reg_*`),
  `apps/registry` (packument + tarball). Proven: `bun add @brika/plugin-weather`
  installs from the registry with the served tarball's SHA-512 matching the
  pinned integrity. Seed importer in `apps/registry/scripts/seed.ts`.
- ✅ **M2 publish domain core** (`registry-core`): `verifyGithubOidc` and
  `PublishService` (ownership gate -> data gate -> immutability -> integrity ->
  write), fully unit-tested.
- ✅ **M2 endpoints**: `POST /-/publish` (OIDC or registry token -> `PublishIdentity`
  -> D1 `OwnershipPolicy` + `@brika/schema` `ManifestValidator` -> `PublishService`
  -> R2/D1 writers), `/-/device/code` + `/-/device/token` (RFC 8628), audited via
  `reg_audit`. `REGISTRY_URL` pins the packument's tarball origin (no `Host`
  trust). Proven round-trip with the example plugins.
- ✅ **Management**: `ManagementService` (deprecate + yank, ownership-gated,
  reversible) behind `POST /-/package/:name/:version/{deprecate,yank}` and the
  `brika deprecate` / `brika yank` CLI commands. Yank hides a version from new
  installs (packument + catalog) while keeping the bytes; deprecate surfaces a
  warning. Audited.
- ⬜ **M3 hub install**: ship the `@brika:registry` scoped-registry config; verify
  an end-to-end install of an `@brika` plugin into a hub from the registry.
- ✅ **M4 store integration**: the storefront is registry-only , it reads every
  listed plugin from the registry and never from npm. A `/-/v1/packages` catalog
  (npm has no list endpoint) + the npm-compatible packument feed the listing,
  detail, and scope pages; tarball-bundled assets (icon, screenshots, readme,
  localized `store.json`) are extracted and served by the store
  (`/v1/plugins/:name/asset`, R2-cached) so plugins render with localized copy.
  Proven end to end with Playwright.
- ⬜ **M5 community scopes** (later): let community claim scopes and publish to
  the registry; the storefront lists those scoped, verified plugins (it does not
  list from npm).
- 🟡 **M6 hardening**: done so far - tarball-origin pinning, asset path-traversal
  guard, scoped read-only CORS, ownership-gated management, audit log, and
  **rate limits** on the abuse-prone mutating endpoints (`POST /-/publish` by
  principal, `POST /-/device/code` by IP) via a generic `@brika/router`
  rate-limiting system (`RateLimiter` port + pure `FixedWindowRateLimiter` +
  `rateLimit` middleware) with a Cloudflare-binding adapter in the registry, and
  **operator takedown/restore** (`REGISTRY_ADMINS` + `requireAdmin`; hides a version
  from installs like a yank but admin-gated with a public reason surfaced in the
  packument), and a **malware-scan hook**: a `TarballScanner` port slotted into the
  publish pipeline (after immutability, before integrity/write) so a real scanner
  drops in without touching the orchestration; allow-all today (`NoopTarballScanner`),
  a refused scan surfaces as a `rejected` code (422) and is audited. Remaining:
  R2 + D1 backups. Plan: [`m6-hardening-plan.md`](./m6-hardening-plan.md).

## Brika repo (separate)

- ⬜ **CLI** (`@brika/sdk` lean bin): `brika auth login` (device flow +
  SecretStore keychain), `brika auth logout`, `brika publish` (build the tarball,
  auto-detect CI/OIDC vs keychain token, upload), `brika install` (write the
  scoped-registry config).
- ✅ **`@brika/schema`**: per-locale store metadata (assets in `package.json`:
  `icon` required, `screenshots` optional as `{ src, caption?, alt? }[]`;
  localized text in `locales/<lang>/store.json`: `title`, `description`,
  `screenshotCaptions?`). Required at publish: icon + title + description. Both
  `brika publish`/`pack` and the registry's `/-/publish` gate validate every
  bundled locale file against `StoreLocaleSchema` (the gate untars via
  `readTarGzEntries`). Serving localized copy to the storefront is M4.
- ⬜ **Hub** (`apps/hub`): `RemoteRegistrySource` is already added (federation);
  add the `@brika:registry` install config.

## Operator tasks (🔑 cannot be automated)

1. Cloudflare: `wrangler d1 create brika-store`, `kv namespace create`,
   `r2 bucket create brika-store-assets` and `brika-registry-tarballs`; paste ids
   into the two `wrangler.jsonc`; attach custom domains `store.brika.dev` and
   `registry.brika.dev`.
2. GitHub OAuth app (store sign-in + device flow) -> `wrangler secret put`
   `SESSION_SECRET`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`.
3. GitHub OIDC: register the `brika-publish` workflow as a trusted publisher for
   the registry audience.
4. `bun run --filter @brika/store-web deploy` and
   `bun run --filter @brika/registry deploy`.

See [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](../DEPLOYMENT.md) for the store; registry deploy mirrors it.

## Recommended next steps (in order)

The publish/resolve/store-integration core is shipped (registry M1, M2, M4 and the
`@brika/schema` data gate are all done and proven). What remains, in order:

1. **brika CLI** `auth login` / `publish` / `install` (separate brika repo), then a
   full publish -> resolve -> `bun add` round-trip against a deployed registry. This
   is the missing piece that exercises the whole pipeline end to end.
2. **Registry M3 hub install**: ship the `@brika:registry` scoped-registry config and
   verify an `@brika` plugin installs into a hub from the registry. Closes the loop.
3. **M6 hardening remainder**: malware-scan hook on publish + R2/D1 backups (origin
   pinning, path-traversal guard, CORS, ownership gates, audit log, rate limits, and
   operator takedown/restore are already done).
4. **Pick the store design direction** (Spotlight vs Console), finish the redesign
   across browse/detail/scope/dashboard, then build the remaining console slices
   (review responses, comment moderation). Scope claiming +
   management already shipped (ORG-004/005/007/009/010).
5. **Identity-tied claiming (ORG-006)**: implement a real `ClaimVerifier` behind the
   seam so a name can only be claimed by an identity that provably controls it.
6. **Verified-list signing**: the Ed25519 `/v1/verified` signing key (today the
   verified list is empty). The store is registry-only , no npm catalog to sync.
